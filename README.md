# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 programming puzzles. Each day's solution is typically found in a `dayXX.py` file, with its corresponding input in `dayXX_input.txt`.

## Structure

- `dayXX.py`: Python script containing the solution for Day XX.
- `dayXX_input.txt`: Input data for Day XX.

## How to Run

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the project directory and execute the Python script:

```bash
python dayXX.py
```
Replace `XX` with the desired day number.

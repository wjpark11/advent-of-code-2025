# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 programming puzzles. Each day's solution is typically found in a `dayXX.py` file, with its corresponding input in `dayXX_input.txt`.

## Structure

- `dayXX.py`: Python script containing the solution for Day XX.
- `dayXX_input.txt`: Input data for Day XX.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event of a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. You can find more information and the puzzles themselves at the official website: [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

## How to Run

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the project directory and execute the Python script:

```bash

```
Replace `XX` with the desired day number.
